# ClassicThreatMeter (Experimental)
A simple threat meter for WoW Classic (1.13.2)

**Notes:**
 - Other players must have ClassicThreatMeter or a compatible AddOn enabled in order to track their threat similar to how KTM/Omen required compatible AddOns communicating threat to one another in Vanilla/TBC.
 - This has yet to be tested in Classic. Please forgive any bugs that may arise on launch day and allow me some time to fix them.
 - Configuration is limited to what is available in the `/ctm` slash command until I implement a more robust GUI config.
